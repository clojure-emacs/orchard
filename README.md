# orchard

A Clojure library designed to provide common functionality for Clojure
development tools (e.g. CIDER).

## History

Originally [SLIME][] was the most
popular way to program in Clojure with Emacs and a lot of useful
functionality was created for it to support things like code
completion, value inspection, finding references, apropos and so
on. This functionality was implemented as a swank adapter written in
Clojure and lived in the
[swank-clojure][] project.

Subsequently [CIDER][] and
[cider-nrepl][] replaced
SLIME and swank, and much code was moved from `swank-clojure` to
`cider-nrepl` and continued to evolve there.

You can watch the presentation [The Evolution of the Emacs tooling for
  Clojure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X-1fJm25Ww&list=PLZdCLR02grLoc322bYirANEso3mmzvCiI&index=6)
  to learn more about all of this.

This project is an effort to prevent repeating the mistakes of the
past - `cider-nrepl` was split into two libraries, so that non-nREPL
clients can make of use of the general functionality contained in
`cider-nrepl` (e.g. things like `apropos`, `inspect`, etc).

Much of the tooling code required to build Clojure editors and smart REPLs
is tool-agnostic and *should* be reused between tools, instead of copied
and altered in each and every tool.

## API Documentation

Documentation for the master branch as well as tagged releases are available
[here](https://cljdoc.org/d/cider/orchard).

## Usage

**orchard requires Clojure 1.8+ and Java 8+.**

Just add `orchard` as a dependency and start hacking.

```clojure
[cider/orchard "0.4.0"]
```

Right now `orchard` provides functionality like:

* enhanced apropos
* classpath utils
* value inspector
* Java class handling utilities
* Utilities for dealing with metadata
* Namespace utilities

Consult the API documentation to get a better idea about the
functionality that's provided.
