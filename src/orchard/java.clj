;;; ## Java Class/Member Info
;;
;; Getting class and member info (i.e. type hierarchy, method names,
;; argument/return types, etc) is straightforward using reflection; this
;; provides the basis of Java metadata support. When the source is available
;; (and a Java parser is too), we supplement reflection with source analysis to
;; get file, line, and column info, as well as docstrings and argument names.

;;; ## Classpath
;;
;; Java source files are resolved from the classpath. For library dependencies,
;; this simply entails having the corresponding source artifacts in the
;; project's dev dependencies. The core Java API classes are the exception to
;; this, since these are external to lein/maven dependency management. For
;; these, we search the JDK directory and add the source classpath entry
;; manually, if available. Prior to JDK9, parsing source files also requires
;; having `tools.jar` on the classpath, which we'll have to add as well.

(defn jdk-find
  "Search common JDK path configurations for a specified file name and return a
  URL if found. This accommodates `java.home` being set to either the JDK root
  (JDK9+) or a JRE directory within this (JDK 8), and searches both the home and
  `lib` directories."
  [f]
  (let [home (io/file (System/getProperty "java.home"))
        parent (.getParentFile home)
        paths [(io/file home f)
               (io/file home "lib" f)
               (io/file parent f)
               (io/file parent "lib" f)]]
    (->> paths (filter #(.canRead %)) first io/as-url)))

(def jdk-sources
  "The JDK sources path. If found on the existing classpath, this is the
  corresponding classpath entry. Otherwise, the JDK directory is searched for
  the file `src.zip`, and if found this added to the classpath."
  (let [base-url (fn [path]
                   (some-> (io/resource path)

        (some-> (jdk-find "src.zip") cp/add-classpath!))))

(def jdk-tools
  "The `tools.jar` path, for JDK8 and earlier. If found on the existing
  classpath, this is the corresponding classpath entry. Otherwise, if available,
  this is added to the classpath."

;;; ## Javadoc URLs
;;
;; Relative Javadoc URLs can be constructed from class/member signatures.
;;
;; N.b. Where a method's bytecode signature differs from its declared signature
;; (other than collection generics), the javadoc method URL can't be inferred as
;; done below. (Specifically, this applies to varargs and non-collection
;; generics, e.g. `java/misc/Arrays.html#asList(T...)`.) Since the member is
;; just a URL fragment, the javadoc link will simply navigate to the parent
;; class in these cases.

;; As of Java 11, Javadoc URLs begin with the module name.
(declare module-name)

;;; ## Source Analysis
;;
;; Java parser support is available for JDK9+ and JDK8 and below via separate
;; namespaces, `java.parser` and `java.legacy-parser`. The former uses only
;; external JDK APIs and supports modular (Jigsaw) sources. The latter uses
;; internal APIs out of necessity. Once this project discontinues support for
;; JDK8, the legacy parser may be removed.

;;; ## Class Metadata Assembly

;; We construct metadata at the class level, first using `reflect-info` to

;; merged with a source analysis pass (when available) from `source-info`. The
;; nested map structure and keys returned by these two functions is identical
;; for the same class. Class members are indexed first by name, then argument
;; types.
