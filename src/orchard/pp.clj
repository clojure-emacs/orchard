  "A pretty-printer for Clojure data structures. This namespace is borrowed from
  Eero Helenius' pp project and modified according to Orchard needs. Linear
  printing parts were replaced with substitutes from `orchard.print` for reuse
  and consistency.

  Based on the algorithm described in \"Pretty-Printing, Converting List
  to Linear Structure\" by Ira Goldstein (Artificial Intelligence, Memo
  No. 279 in Massachusetts Institute of Technology A.I. Laboratory,
  February 1973)."
