Before submitting a PR make sure the following things have been done:

- [ ] The commits are consistent with our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] You've added tests to cover your change(s)
- [ ] All tests are passing
- [ ] The new code is not generating reflection warnings

Keep in mind that new orchard builds are automatically deployed to Clojars
once a PR is merged, but **only** if the CI build is green.

Thanks!
